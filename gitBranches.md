# Git Branches

Git branches are used to create separate lines of development in a repository, allowing multiple features, bug fixes, or experiments to be worked on simultaneously.

## Key Commands for Git Branches:
- **List all branches**: `git branch`

- **Rename a branch**:  ` git branch -m <new-branchName`

- **Create a new branch**: `git branch <branch-name>`

- **Switch to a branch**: `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`

- **Create and switch to a branch**: `git checkout -b <branch-name>` or `git switch -c <branch-name>`

- **Delete a branch**: `git branch -d <branch-name>`

- **Force delete a branch**: `git branch -D <branch-name>`

- **List remote branches**: `git branch -r`

- **Push a branch to a remote**: `git push origin <branch-name>`

- **Merge a branch into the current branch**: `git merge <branch-name>`

Branches provide flexibility for parallel development, making version control more efficient.
