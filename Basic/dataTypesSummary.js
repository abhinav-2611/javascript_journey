/* 1--> javascript is dynamically typed language as we don't need to declare the type of variable explicitly , the type of varialble 
 is decided at the run time based on the value assingned to it 
 
 2--> console.log(NaN===NaN); // False  :NaN is the only value in JavaScript that's not equal to itself
